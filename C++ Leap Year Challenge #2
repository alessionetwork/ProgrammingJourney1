Let’s try a challenging problem that will put all your brain cells to the test.

Write a leap_year.cpp program that:

Takes a year as input.
Checks to see if the year is a four-digit number.
Displays whether or not the year falls on a leap year.
There are 3 criteria that must be taken into account to identify a leap year:

If the year can be evenly divided by 4 then it is a leap year, however…

If that year is evenly divisible by 400, then it is a leap year.

#include

int main() {
int year;
std::cout << "Write any year you want\n ";
std::cin >> year;
if (year >999 && year < 10000) {
std::cout << "The year you gave me has 4 digits\n";
}
if (year % 4 ==0 or year % 400 ==0 ) {
std::cout << "The year you gave me is a leap year.\n";
}
else {
std::cout << "The year you gave me isn't a leap year.\n";
}
}
